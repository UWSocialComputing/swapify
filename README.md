Welcome to your CSE 481p repo!

This repo will serve as a place to both collaborate on code with your group members as well as create your blog sites for your projects. It contains a `_config.yml` file that automatically turns your `README.md` files into webpages hosted on GitHub pages.

Please refer to the README in [this repo](https://github.com/nicolas-van/easy-markdown-to-github-pages) for more on the markdown to webpage generation process. Most of the steps have already been done for you, so the most relevant content will likely be in the User Guide and the sections following that.

If you want to change the site's Jekyll template and/or add custom CSS, please refer to [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/adding-a-theme-to-your-github-pages-site-using-jekyll).

You may also find this [GitHub markdown cheatsheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet) handy.
