The intent is to search for items people want to receive by trading something they have that is deemed of equal value. Many platforms allow for planning trades, such as Discord, Facebook, Instagram, OfferUp, Mercari, Reddit, Depop, Messenger, Craigslist, etc. Additionally, most people ask for proof before trading or may even look up the traderâ€™s history to ensure reliability, which can add stress for an individual. Additionally, we found that the majority do not want to trade internationally. Something interesting we discovered was that scammers are placed in a public hall of shame to warn others from trading with them. Last but not least, the things that people are interested in trading are traded by users interested in plants, trading cards, collectible figurines, etc.
