# User Research Report
## Summary
For our project, we are creating an online platform where individuals can trade physical and virtual small collectibles such as blind boxes, stickers, washi tape, cards, and plants. Trading can be done both in person or via shipping. Initially, our team had considered allowing all sorts of tradeable items but ultimately decided that tracking large items would be incredibly difficult for users and implementers alike. For example, the shipping cost for larger items would increase due to the weight, size, and extra material needed to ship an item safely. Not to mention, based on our experiences and those who participated in our survey, there is no dedicated online space solely for trading. Regarding certain items that can be considered fragile, a set of rules would be set to help facilitate the best shipping experience possible. Swapify facilitates item-by-item trades between users and has set bans for users if scamming occurs.

In terms of a target audience, we are aiming to target anyone within the country, giving this particular audience more flexibility when conducting trade with other people within the United States. It is easier to support individuals trading items within the US, especially with the restrictions and regulations regarding fees when shipped internationally. Our primary focus is on those who prefer to trade shippable items.

## Methodology
As for our research methods, we chose two different methods to collect user data. One method was an online anonymous survey that allowed users to respond candidly through Google Forms. We intentionally chose a survey over interviews, as many trades utilize a platform to plan and facilitate the trades. Thus, we could explore networks already set in place. It consisted of 8 questions regarding the trading process. Questions focused on gaining insight into current platform popularity, trading experiences, precautions taken when trading, and negative experiences about specific scenarios like international trades or language barriers. Using the survey, we targeted four main forums: EdStem, Facebook (Groups), Messenger, and Discord. These communities varied in geographical ranges, ranging from local Seattle/Washington to a national level. While this does mean our results may focus on a specific area/local trading in the United States, we believe the results would still be valuable in determining our project direction.

Another research method conducted was fly-on-the-wall observations, where we observed people trading items in a virtual setting using the chosen trading platforms. Here are our observations:
- Individuals conduct shipping on their own using various platforms.
- There are designated virtual spaces to post available items for trade.
- Interest in specific trades is public to all individuals in these communities.
- There exists structure to trades even if no rules are set in place.
- Transactions are made among community members.
- Users conduct shipping on their own, occasionally with no rules or regulations.
- Trades occur for whoever is online and happen pretty fast.
- Proof of life occurs in public channels that help with fewer scams.
  - Example: Individuals must take a picture of their item with a note that contains their full name/username alongside the day’s date.
- Some trading groups are close-knit communities that share interests, are very welcoming to newcomers, and are interested in facilitating trades between members

After deciding on these data collection methods, each group member dove into their communities and found 1-2 trading communities where they were lurkers or active participants. We chose figurine trading Seattle Sonny Angels Discord Server, a WA Rare Plants BST Facebook Group, Travel Town Trading Cards, Blind Boxes (Smiski, Sonny Angels) trading Discord/Reddit, and Karuta Hub Discord. We obtained various opinions based on our interests and communities. However, we wanted to open our survey to a more general audience, regardless of a direct tie to an online trading community. Thus, we also posted to the Allen School Undergraduates Ed Discussion Board and our CSE&481P Discord Server. As mentioned earlier, there were geographical differences in these communities. However, these communities have things in common: they all trade items through an online platform, and each platform/community has a particular system with specific rules and routines.

## Key Results
From our survey, we obtained 37 responses. Of the responses, 78% said they used Facebook to trade items, and the remaining 12% was split evenly between Reddit, Discord, and Instagram. When asked about their preference for trading, 47% of people preferred to trade in person, 10% preferred to ship, and 43% of respondents did both in-person and shipped trades. Regarding trading, many responders take precautions by asking for more information on their items through photos and checking the other trader’s profile and history by researching. Many stated they preferred trading in person for this reason.

A significant problem when trading is the fear of getting scammed or ghosted. 24% reported that they had been scammed before, 13% reported being ghosted, and 24% have not been ghosted or scammed; the remaining had otherwise. We also asked about their willingness to trade internationally, and 70% said they wouldn’t due to expensive shipping, more risks involved, and unfamiliarity with international shipping.

Some key takeaways were that many individuals utilize Facebook for trading despite needing a designated place to track their trade. However, we noticed that an item of higher value usually gets traded with something of equal value. With Swapify, we’re facilitating users in trading numerous items to equal items of higher value. Many stated that they would not be comfortable trading internationally. After our research, we found out that there is a need for a trading platform where people can both ship and meet in person to conduct a trade. Noticeably, when people discover scammers on their trading platforms, they are put on blast in a public hall of shame so people are aware not to conduct trade with them. Additionally, we saw that some people made decisions that led to negative emotions, such as fear and greed when trading. Despite this, there is a big focus on community within trading groups.

## Analysis According to AEIOU Framework
The intent is to search for items people want to receive by trading something they have that is deemed of equal value. Many platforms allow for planning trades, such as Discord, Facebook, Instagram, OfferUp, Mercari, Reddit, Depop, Messenger, Craigslist, etc. Additionally, most people ask for proof before trading or may even look up the trader’s history to ensure reliability, which can add stress for an individual. Additionally, we found that the majority do not want to trade internationally. Something interesting we discovered was that scammers are placed in a public hall of shame to warn others from trading with them. Last but not least, the things that people are interested in trading are traded by users interested in plants, trading cards, collectible figurines, etc.
